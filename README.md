This project is focused on building end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a house price prediction system.
This pipeline is developed using ZenML, MlOps framework that helps in managing machine learning workflows, and Mlflow, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.
The primary goal is to predict house prices based on various features of properties, such as the size, location, and condition


But what is new?
1. Thorough Explorartion of Data
2. Structured data Processing
3. Focusing on Robustness of the model
4. MLops and production readiness
